## 🐕‍🦺 Your Browser History's Conversational AI is Man's Best Friend 

This particular dog is an expert at paperwork; he's your own personal Google. He learns your behaviours by watching how you use the web.

DigGRR lives, optionally, in the lower corner of the browser. You can give him commands to easily find places you've been before by describing it in natural language. You can describe the content, the type of thing it is, or even how it looks or what data or pictures are on the page.

## 🔏 Privacy & Your Personal Data 
You don't have to worry bout where your data is or how it's being used, DigGRR ensures to never store PII (Personally Identifiable Information) and he uses strong encryption for you data at all times-- in motion and at rest. Finally, DigGRR never actually takes your data-- he stores it in a SOLID pod that you control! Pods are like secure personal web servers for data. When data is stored in your Pod, you control who and what can access it; It means that we respect your privacy and want you to know where your data is. We want to empower you to always have control of your browsing data.
